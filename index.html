      <h2>For Martial Artists + Educators + Scientists</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Martial Methodology, where the art of combat meets the science of learning. My band of misfits and I
      are going to disrupt the status quo of curriculum and instruction in the martial arts world, and hopefully revolutionize how it's 
taught while we're at it.</p>
      <p>Nothing is off limits here. We discuss motor learning and educational psychology and how it relates to everything from course design to teaching individuals with special needs -- even to coaching high-level athletes. Stay tuned, stay focused, and don't miss a word, because this isn't light reading.</p>
      <p>But it's oh so worth it.</p>
